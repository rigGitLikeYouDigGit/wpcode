Testing the principles explored in Raf Anzovin's incredible blog

The higher parts of it can wait for another time - just the posing
capability will be hugely useful




We limit to tree-like or tree-homeomorphic graphs for now -
that's not a limitation on this system, it's just because I can't think
of a way to present a densely-connected control scheme to the user.
I guess it could be useful for cloth or something.

for expanding influence from controls, increase depth
not by individual nodes, but by SECTIONS

eg not hand1, forearm, upperArm, clavicle etc -
rather hand, arm, torso, etc

These sections might be defined explicitly, or could be inferred by
finding regions between "breakpoint" nodes

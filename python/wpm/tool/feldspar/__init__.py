"""mechanical linkage decomposition
and optimisation

just trying a phd-level problem with my
janky vfx brain


going full python-vomit on this at first
so I understand it, classes for everything

two parts to this - solving, and synthesis
(since we can only verify synthesis by solving)
there's a library called pyslvs that looks amazing, but
it's only for python 3.8 :'(

so we do it ourselves for now, closely referencing a project
https://github.com/hrldcpr/linkages/tree/master/python

even point welds are a constraint now - just easier in terms of logic
and dependency to keep that part uniform

"""

can we make our api package threadsafe somehow?


if a thread calls "om.MDagNode.setParent()", can the "om." go through a
check to see if maya is currently executing a callback, or busy?
and if so wait until it isn't?


there are still quite a few areas to develop:

PLUGS : 
	- setting and retrieving correctly typed values from MPlugs
	- check typing validity of nodes
	- descriptors for __set__, rshift connection operators
	- pathable syntax for slicing
	- broadcasting 
	
NODES :
	- got generation working in principle
	

WN() raw errors
WN("nodeThatDoesn'tExist") errors?
WN("myExistingNode") returns best-fitting wrapper instance on that node

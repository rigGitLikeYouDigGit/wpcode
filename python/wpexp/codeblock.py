"""sketch or idea for the future idk, 
for composing/filtering a list, consider an interface 
like code blocks in scratch - 
depending on context, simple operations can be shown by
colour of the block's outline, or their outputs can be
routed to more complex function blocks by lines

in effect this is a specialised and tightly-controlled node graph - 
is it worth building a whole new system for it?

an overall execution line could accumulate results from different
blocks of operations
